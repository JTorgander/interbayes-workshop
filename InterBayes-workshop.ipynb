    "Using the posterior predictive distribution as a reference, we could inspect the progress when going from our baseline normal model to the final Negative Binomial model. In this last section we will evaluate and compare our three candidate models using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) using the $\\verb|loo|$ package. Recall from the lecture slides that a useful metric for the fit of a Bayesian model is the expected log predictive density (ELPD) given by the following expression,\n",

The function  $\\verb|loo|$ from the  $\\verb|loo|$-package estimates the ELPD using leave-one-out cross-validation together with Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS-LOO-CV). To do this, the $\\verb|loo|$ function takes as input evaluations of the log likelihood evaluated at the drawn samples, corresponding to the $\\log(p_{post}(\\hat{y}|\\theta))$ component in the expression (5). \n",
